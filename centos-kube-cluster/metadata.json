  "summary": "This template deploys a kubernetes cluster that consists of a master and 2-10 nodes (minions). The deployment has been tested on CentOS 7.1. It utilizes systemd and etcd. There is just one instance of etcd that runs on the kubernetes master. The master constitues a single point of failure so it really doesn't matter if etcd is highly available.",
